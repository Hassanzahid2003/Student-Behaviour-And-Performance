# Student Behavior Analysis Project

## Overview

This project explores a dataset of student behaviors, including academic performance, demographic information, and lifestyle factors. The goal is to identify patterns and insights that could help improve student outcomes.

## Files

*   **`EDA_on_Student_behaviour_Dataset.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the exploratory data analysis.

## Data Source

The dataset consists of 5,000 rows and 23 columns, covering various aspects of student life. Key attributes include academic scores (attendance, midterm, final), demographics (gender, age, department), and lifestyle factors (study hours, extracurricular activities, stress levels).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The `EDA_on_Student_behaviour_Dataset.ipynb` notebook performs the following analyses:

*   **Dataset Overview**: Examination of the dataset's structure and initial descriptive statistics.
*   **Data Cleaning**: Identification and handling of missing values.
*   **Statistical Summaries**: Calculation of descriptive statistics for numerical variables.

## Key Insights

*   Average attendance is 75.43% with a standard deviation of 14.37%.
*   Stress levels range from 1 to 10, with a mean of 5.48.
*   The scatterplot visualization (`image.jpg`) shows the distribution of sleep hours per night across different departments.
