📊 Student Behavior Analysis Project
🧠 Overview
This project explores a dataset of student behaviors, academic performance, demographics, and lifestyle factors to uncover patterns that may influence student success. The objective is to provide actionable insights that could help educators and administrators improve student outcomes.

📁 Files
EDA_on_Student_behaviour_Dataset.ipynb — Jupyter Notebook containing the full exploratory data analysis process.

📚 Data Source
The dataset consists of 5,000 rows and 23 columns, capturing:

Academic metrics: Attendance, Midterm Score, Final Score

Demographics: Gender, Age, Department

Lifestyle factors: Study hours, Sleep hours, Extracurricular activities, Stress levels

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The notebook performs a comprehensive EDA, including:

Dataset Overview: Structural summary and initial statistics

Data Cleaning: Handling of missing values and inconsistent data

Descriptive Statistics: Summaries of numerical and categorical variables

Visualizations:

Histograms and box plots for distribution analysis

Scatter plots for feature relationships

Correlation heatmaps for identifying strong associations

🔍 Key Insights
Average Attendance: 75.43% (std: 14.37%)

Mean Stress Level: 5.48 (scale 1–10)

Sleep Analysis: A scatter plot showed the distribution of sleep hours per night across departments, revealing that students in certain departments sleep less on average.

Study vs. Performance: Positive correlation found between study hours and academic scores.

📌 Conclusion
This project highlights how behavioral and lifestyle data can inform academic interventions. It lays the groundwork for predictive modeling or clustering in future stages.
